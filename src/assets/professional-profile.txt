I'm software engineer experienced at Game Development and Web Development,
currently focusing my attention on developing myself more as a Full Stack software engineer.
While working on project, I'm focused on a solving of the global issues and creating reliable and maintainable architecture
more than on focusing on a smaller project parts. I'm always open for new technologies.
Would like to take part in some of the Web 3.0 or/and AI projects. I would like to take more responsibilities as a team leader
and participate in mentorship programs. In spare time I learn interesting technologies, that might be not useful
for me on real projects but make me see things from the different perspective. My strongest professional quality is an adaptivity along with
ability to learn and become fluent in almost any technology (depends on its main paradigms) really fast.
